# DSA Interview Preparation Plan

## Current Progress Analysis
- **Total Progress**: 105/455 questions (23%)
- **Completed Areas**: Strong in basics (31/31) and arrays (38/40)
- **Focus Areas Needed**: Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Sliding Window, Graphs, Trees

## 8-Week Strategic Learning Plan

### Week 1-2: Sliding Window & Two Pointers (Priority Focus)
- **Goal**: Complete 12/12 problems
- **Learning Strategy**:
  1. Master the fixed-size window technique
  2. Learn variable-size window with specific conditions
  3. Practice two-pointer approach for sorted arrays
  4. Apply to problems requiring optimization
- **Key Patterns**:
  - Fixed window for subarrays of size k
  - Variable window with constraints
  - Two pointers from both ends
  - Fast and slow pointers

### Week 3-4: Trees & Graphs (Foundation Building)
- **Goal**: Complete 20/39 Binary Tree problems, 15/54 Graph problems
- **Learning Strategy**:
  1. Master tree traversals (pre/in/post-order, level order)
  2. Learn graph representations (adjacency list/matrix)
  3. Practice DFS and BFS for both trees and graphs
  4. Solve path-finding and connectivity problems
- **Key Patterns**:
  - Tree traversal techniques
  - Graph search algorithms
  - Detecting cycles
  - Topological sorting
  - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, BFS)

### Week 5-6: Dynamic Programming (Deep Dive)
- **Goal**: Complete 20/56 DP problems
- **Learning Strategy**:
  1. Start with basic problems (1D DP)
  2. Progress to 2D DP problems
  3. Learn state compression techniques
  4. Practice optimization problems
- **Key Patterns**:
  - Memoization vs Tabulation
  - State definition and transitions
  - Overlapping subproblems
  - Common patterns: LIS, knapsack, coin change, etc.

### Week 7: Backtracking & Recursion
- **Goal**: Complete 10/25 recursion problems
- **Learning Strategy**:
  1. Understand the backtracking template
  2. Practice decision tree visualization
  3. Learn pruning techniques
  4. Apply to combinatorial problems
- **Key Patterns**:
  - Decision making at each step
  - State exploration and backtracking
  - Constraint satisfaction
  - Permutations and combinations

### Week 8: Review & Advanced Topics
- **Goal**: Review weak areas, practice mixed problems
- **Learning Strategy**:
  1. Take mock interviews
  2. Time yourself on new problems
  3. Review and optimize previous solutions
  4. Learn advanced data structures (Trie, Segment Tree)

## Daily Study Routine
1. **Morning (1 hour)**:
   - Learn/review theoretical concept
   - Solve 1 easy problem on the topic

2. **Evening (2 hours)**:
   - Solve 1-2 medium/hard problems
   - Review and optimize solutions
   - Document patterns and insights

3. **Weekend (4 hours)**:
   - Mock interviews
   - Revision of weak areas
   - Mixed problem solving

## Problem-Solving Framework
For each problem, follow this approach:
1. Understand the problem completely
2. Think of brute force solution
3. Optimize step by step
4. Code the solution
5. Test with examples and edge cases
6. Analyze time and space complexity
7. Document the pattern/approach for revision

## Spaced Repetition Strategy
- Create flashcards for key algorithms and patterns
- Review solutions from 1 day ago, 3 days ago, and 7 days ago
- Maintain a "weak topics" list for extra focus

## Resources
- LeetCode for practice
- Striver's A2Z DSA Course
- Visualizations: visualgo.net
- Books: "Cracking the Coding Interview", "Elements of Programming Interviews"

## Progress Tracking
- Update completion status weekly
- Note difficult problems for revisiting
- Track time taken per problem to measure improvement
